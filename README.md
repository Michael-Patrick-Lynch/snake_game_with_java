# Snake on the command line - with Java
Small CLI project to get familiar with Java.

### Controls

Control the snake by pressing one of the WASD keys followed by the enter key to make a move.
If you don't press enter, nothing will happen. 
If you press multiple keys followed by enter, nothing will happen.
You have to press a single WASD key followed by the enter key to make the snake move in that direction.


### Installation
